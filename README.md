Short project containing example of using PCA on dataset including informations about Premier League players in 19/20 season.</br>
Te check results received using reduced dimensionality data classification task was made, using weighted nearest neighbor algorithm and random forest model.</br>
Simple and short comparison between this models based on 'pca data' and unchanged data with 7 variables chosen via SelectKBest function showed that models trained on 'pca data' was a bit worse than those trained on unchanged data, although the difference was not so huge.</br> 
At the end, 3D visualization of dataset after using PCA was included.
